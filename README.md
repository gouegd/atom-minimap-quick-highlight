# minimap-quick-highlight package for Atom

An integration between the `minimap` and `quick-highlight` packages for the Atom text editor.

Warning - it's fresh out of the oven.
* Handles quick-highlight's manual and automatic toggles
* Uses the same colors than quick-highlight (dumbly copying its less rules)
